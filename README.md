# GA-Final_Project
A README.md file with five parts:
    Your problem statement. What is the problem you're trying to solve?
    A brief summary of your solution to the problem. Make this readable so a person without a technical background could understand how you solve       the problem! If you can, include why your solution matters. (Brief: somewhere around 4-6 sentences, but this isn't a hard rule.)
    A summary of your technical solution. This can include more technical descriptions of the work you did.
    A brief summary of each of the files in your repository.
