# GA-Final_Project
    Have you ever been interested in coffee? I am a big coffee drinker and my final project idea is analying coffee. I found some data on Kaggle and want to see if it's possible to find the best quality of coffee based on different aspects or characteristics. And if so, which one matters the most or the correlation between the coffee.
    A brief summary of your solution to the problem. Make this readable so a person without a technical background could understand how you solvebthe problem! If you can, include why your solution matters. (Brief: somewhere around 4-6 sentences, but this isn't a hard rule.)

    A summary of your technical solution. This can include more technical descriptions of the work you did.
